CAD Models for Motor &amp; Battery Mountings + Laser Cutting

I hope some of this might be useful to you.  Although the models were created for a General, the Electric Motor Mounting frame should be the same for RZR & Ranger XP1000 models.  You'll have to figure out the battery mountings yourself!

My conversion is based around a Hyper9 Motor which I'm rating at 50kW.  Geared 1:1 it should give a similar performance envelope to the original engine with the added low end torque & control you get with Electric.

The motor is capable of delivering at least 75kW - but my batteries have a max discharge current of 500A.  I'm running 32 x LiFePO4 Cells, giving a nominal of 108.8V, so an absolute max of 54.4kW.

With a ratio between the Motor & final drive gearbox, that should give a top speed of just over 60mph in high range.  That's probably sufficient.  It starts to get a bit sketchy above that anyway.

There are 32 Series BYD 125Ah Cells, giving 13.6kWh capacity which I hope will give me about 50 miles of driving at 30mph.  The Data Sheet for the cells is in the repository.
Although they're mostly used for Solar Storage, I've heard good reports about using them in EV's.  Pricing is keen at the moment too.

Drop me a line if you need help.  There's a build thread on DIYElectricCar.com too.
